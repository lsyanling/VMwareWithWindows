Files
=====

ZIMPL files:

* rta.zpl: implements the response-time analysis (reads tasks.txt and processors.txt)
* map.zpl: implements (optional) task-to-processor mapping (reads tasks.txt)
* chains.zpl: reads chains.txt
* dataage.zpl: implements data-age analysis

Input files: 

* processors.txt: list of processing resources
* tasks.txt: list of tasks and their properties
* chains.txt: cause-effect chains

Usage
=====

First, we need to create the LP-file from the ZPL-files by using the `zimpl` binary:

	zimpl chains.zpl rta.zpl dataage.zpl map.zpl -o problem

Note that `map.zpl` is optional and can be omitted if task-to-processor mapping is not fixed.

Second, the generated problem.lp file can be used as an input for any MILP solver, e.g. scip:

	scip
	SCIP> read problem.lp
	SCIP> opt
